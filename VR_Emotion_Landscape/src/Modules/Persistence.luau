-- src/Modules/Persistence.luau
-- This module handles the saving and loading of landscape states.
-- It uses a mock in-memory database for simulation purposes, meaning data
-- is not persisted between separate executions of the application.
-- It includes conceptual notes on how true persistence could be achieved
-- using Luau's Lute runtime or a similar backend system.

local Types = require(script.Parent.Parent.src.Types)
local Logger = require(script.Parent.Parent.src.Modules.Logger)

local Persistence = {}

-- Mock database to store landscape states in memory, keyed by userId.
local mockDatabase: { [string]: Types.LandscapeState } = {}
-- Tracks the last modification timestamp for each user's state, for conceptual synchronization.
local lastModifiedTimestamps: { [string]: number } = {} -- For conceptual sync

--[[
    In a production environment using Luau's Lute runtime,
    actual persistence would involve:
    1. Serialization: Converting the LandscapeState table into a storable format (e.g., JSON, or a binary format).
       Lute can efficiently handle large Luau tables.
    2. Database Interaction: Using an external library or a Lute-compatible interface to communicate
       with a persistent data store (e.g., Redis, PostgreSQL, or a custom game backend).
       Example (conceptual):
       -- Assuming a Lute environment with access to an HTTP service or similar
       -- local httpService = game:GetService("HttpService") -- Or similar for Lute env
       -- local success, result = pcall(function()
       --     local serializedState = httpService:JSONEncode(landscapeState)
       --     -- Send `serializedState` to a backend endpoint:
       --     -- httpService:PostAsync("https://your-game-backend.com/saveState", serializedState)
       -- end)
       -- if not success then
       --     Logger.error("Failed to save state to backend", result) -- Log pcall results
       -- end
    3. Synchronization: For multiplayer, a backend service would manage shared states or deltas.
       Clients would subscribe to updates. Lute's performance would be beneficial for processing
       these updates quickly on the client or server-side Luau environment.
       Timestamping and conflict resolution strategies would be essential.

    Retrieves all landscape states that have been modified since a given timestamp.
    This is a conceptual function for simulating how a client might get updates
    in a multiplayer or shared environment. It's highly simplified.
    @param sinceTimestamp: A Unix timestamp. Only states modified after this time are returned.
    @return A dictionary where keys are userIds and values are their updated LandscapeState.
